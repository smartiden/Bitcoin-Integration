# Bitcoin Integration

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bitcoin integration on the Internet Computer makes it possible for the first time to create Bitcoin smart contracts, that is, smart contracts in the form of canisters running on the Internet Computer that make use of real bitcoin. This integration is made possible through two key components.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first component is <a href="https://broad-casts.ru/doc/12-chain-key-signatures.pdf">chain-key signatures</a>, which enables every canister to obtain ECDSA public keys and get signatures with respect to these keys in a secure manner. Since Bitcoin addresses are tied to ECDSA public keys, having ECDSA public keys on a canister means that the canister can derive its own Bitcoin addresses. Given that the canister can request signatures for any of its public keys using the <a href="https://broad-casts.ru/doc/13-the-internet-computer-interface-specification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IC ECDSA interface</a>, a canister can create Bitcoin transactions with valid signatures that move bitcoins from any of its Bitcoin addresses to any other address.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second component is the integration with Bitcoin at the network level. The Internet Computer replicas have the capability to instantiate a so-called <em>Bitcoin adapter</em>, a process external to the replica process. In a first step, the Bitcoin adapter collects information about nodes in the <a href="https://broad-casts.ru/doc/14-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the-bitcoin-peer-to-peer-network-structure-protocols-and-dynamics.pdf">Bitcoin peer-to-peer network</a> and, once sufficiently many Bitcoin nodes are discovered, it connects to 5 randomly chosen Bitcoin nodes. Since each replica in the subnet performs this operation, the entire subnet has many, mostly distinct connections to the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin adapter uses the standard Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol to get information about the Bitcoin blockchain. Each Bitcoin adapter keeps track of the full Bitcoin block header chain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, the Bitcoin adapter communicates with the replica process to learn about the current Bitcoin state inside the replica. If the Bitcoin adapter learns that a Bitcoin block has not been made available to the replica yet by comparing the block header hashes provided by the replica against its locally available block header chain, the Bitcoin adapter requests the next missing block from the connected Bitcoin nodes and forwards it to the replica upon receipt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the replica, Bitcoin blocks received at the Networking layer are packed into IC blocks and processed in the Consensus and Message Routing layers and finally made available to the&nbsp;<em>Bitcoin canister</em>&nbsp;in the Execution layer. The Bitcoin canister is a canister running in a system subnet whose purpose is to provide Bitcoin-related functionality to other canisters. In particular, it keeps information about the Bitcoin blockchain state and makes this information accessible to other canisters, such as the balance and unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) for any address. Additionally, the fees of the most recent Bitcoin transactions that were put into blocks can be requested from the Bitcoin canister as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bitcoin canister also offers the last piece of crucial functionality: It provides an endpoint for canisters to send Bitcoin transactions, which are made available on the Networking layer where they are forwarded to the Bitcoin adapter. The Bitcoin adapter in turn advertises the transactions to its connected Bitcoin peers and transfers the transaction upon request. Since each replica in the subnet performs this step, every transaction can be dispersed quickly in the Bitcoin network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href="https://broad-casts.ru/doc/13-the-internet-computer-interface-specification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IC management canister interface</a> provides access to all Bitcoin integration endpoints. Their use is illustrated in the following sample flow:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1516,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartiden/Bitcoin-Integration/main/UTXO.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1516"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this figure, a canister first requests the balance and then the UTXOs of a Bitcoin address. Next, it calls the fee endpoint to get recent fees. Lastly, the canister builds a Bitcoin transaction using some of the UTXOs as inputs. For each input, the ECDSA API is called to obtain the required signatures. Finally, the transaction is submitted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept of Bitcoin and blockchain integration is a revolutionary idea that has the potential to change the way value is exchanged and recorded globally. Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, operates on a decentralized blockchain system, offering a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof recording of data. Together, they offer an intriguing prospect for various industries and sectors.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Basics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At its core, Bitcoin blockchain integration is about utilizing the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin to provide new opportunities and solutions for businesses and individuals. The key features of Bitcoin’s blockchain include decentralization, immutability, transparency, and the ability to create smart contracts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Decentralization: Bitcoin’s blockchain operates without the need for central authorities or intermediaries. Every participant in the network has access to the same ledger, and transactions are verified and secured through cryptography and consensus mechanisms.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Immutability: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or manipulate it. This immutability enhances security and trust, making it ideal for record-keeping and audit trails.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Transparency: The Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, meaning anyone can view and verify transactions, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that can be programmed to automatically trigger actions based on predefined rules and conditions. They enable trustless exchanges and automate various processes.</li>

# Broadcast Bitcoin Transaction
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the world of Bitcoin, broadcasting a transaction is a crucial step in the process of transferring funds from one wallet to another. When a user creates a transaction, it needs to be broadcasted to the Bitcoin network so that it can be validated, included in a block, and finally confirmed. This repositories will delve into the details of how transactions are broadcasted into the Bitcoin network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a Transaction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before a transaction can be broadcasted, it needs to be created by the user. This repository contains source code for broadcasting Bitcoin transactions. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the transaction is created, it needs to be broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. This is done by sending the transaction data to one or more Bitcoin nodes. A node is a computer running the Bitcoin software that maintains a copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain and communicates with other nodes to relay transactions and blocks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a node receives a new transaction, it first validates it to ensure that it is properly formatted and follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. If the transaction is valid, the node will then relay it to other nodes it is connected to. This process continues, with each node validating and relaying the transaction until it propagates throughout the entire network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://broad-casts.ru">Transaction Pools</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a transaction is broadcasted, it sits in the transaction pools (also known as mempool) of the nodes that have received it. The transaction pool is a holding area for unconfirmed transactions. Miners, who are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain, select transactions from the pool to include in the next block they mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transactions with higher fees are typically prioritized by miners, as they receive the transaction fees as a reward for their work. This incentivizes users to include a sufficient fee to have their transactions processed quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://broad-casts.ru">Transaction Confirmation</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once a miner successfully mines a block that includes the transaction, the transaction is considered confirmed. The block is then added to the blockchain, and the transaction becomes a permanent part of the Bitcoin ledger. As more blocks are added on top of the block containing the transaction, the number of confirmations for that transaction increases, providing a higher level of assurance that the transaction is irreversible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://broad-casts.ru">Conclusion</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Broadcasting a transaction is a vital step in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It ensures that transactions are communicated to the entire network, validated, and eventually included in the blockchain. By understanding how this process works, users can better appreciate the decentralized and secure nature of Bitcoin transactions.</p>
